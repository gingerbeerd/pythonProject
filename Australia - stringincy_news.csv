Next week, schools in Queensland will be student-free, except for the children of essential workers. WA Premier Mark McGowan asked parents to keep children home if they could, but said schools would remain open next week. Classes will move to online learning in the second term in South Australia. Next week is set to be the final week of regular term in the Northern Territory. But from Monday, April 6 to Thursday, April 9, schools will be pupil-free. Schools will close for an early end-of-term break from next Friday in Tasmania before shifting to distance learning. Schools in Victoria have already started their school holidays after Premier Daniel Andrews brought the break forward to begin on Tuesday. For now, NSW schools remain unaffected but Premier Gladys Berejiklian has told parents they should keep children at home if they can.

It is not recommended by the government still that asymptomatic people get tested because in their results, they provide little yield. However as clusters have. broken out in Victoria and now Sydney, many people have been concerned that there is a conflicting message.  On one hand they're saying anyone who has gone into these areas must be tested regardless of symptoms. On the other hand, they have said asymptomatic people don't require a test.  ***H2 definition is”  ""Open public testing (e.g “drive through” testing available to asymptomatic people)."" This is true, as asymptomatic testing  is ""available"" just not ""recommended"".***  There is a transcript from the Deputy Chief Medical Officer from 12th July that confirms asymptomatic testing:  It has always been ""available"", meeting your criteria, but going one step further, in outbreak areas the medical officer is recommending asymptomatic testing. He admits in this statement that asymptomatic testing has been conducted (therefore available), inferring this is the practice generally aside from cluster areas.  ""The reality, from the Victorian experience that we've seen, is that there have been many, many thousands of tests conducted on asymptomatic individuals for very little yield- but when I say yield very few positives out of the asymptomatic testing that's being conducted down there.  ""The asymptomatic test has a role in places where there's local small clusters, so the Casula case is a very good example. So we don't want to miss any cases in that sort of scenario, therefore we're going to recommend asymptomatic testing.""
